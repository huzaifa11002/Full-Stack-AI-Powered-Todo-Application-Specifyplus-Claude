- [X] CHK020 Success criteria are technology-agnostic where possible
- [X] CHK021 Success criteria cover all P1 user stories

## Assumptions & Constraints

- [X] CHK023 Assumptions section lists all dependencies on existing systems/features

- [X] CHK026 Timeline constraints are documented (if applicable)
- [X] CHK027 Security constraints are explicitly stated
- [X] CHK028 Operational constraints are identified

## Out of Scope

- [X] CHK029 Out of scope section explicitly lists excluded features
- [X] CHK030 At least 10 out of scope items are documented
- [X] CHK031 Out of scope items are specific (not vague like "other features")
- [X] CHK032 Out of scope items help prevent scope creep

## Dependencies & Risks

- [X] CHK033 External dependencies are listed (libraries, services, tools)
- [X] CHK034 Internal dependencies are identified (other features, modules)
- [X] CHK035 Service dependencies are documented
- [X] CHK036 Technical risks are identified with mitigation strategies
- [X] CHK037 Security risks are identified with mitigation strategies
- [X] CHK038 Operational risks are identified with mitigation strategies
- [X] CHK039 Each risk has an impact assessment (Low/Medium/High/Critical)

## Content Quality

- [X] CHK040 Specification is written in clear, professional language
- [X] CHK041 Technical terms are used correctly and consistently
- [X] CHK042 No placeholder text remains (e.g., [TODO], [TBD], [PLACEHOLDER])
- [X] CHK043 Acceptance scenarios are realistic and testable
- [X] CHK044 Requirements are consistent with user stories
- [X] CHK045 Success criteria align with functional requirements

## Completeness Check

- [X] CHK046 All 4 user stories have complete acceptance scenarios
- [X] CHK047 All 33 functional requirements are specific and actionable
- [X] CHK048 All 10 success criteria are measurable
- [X] CHK049 All 15 assumptions are documented
- [X] CHK050 All 20 out of scope items are listed
- [X] CHK051 Dependencies section covers external, internal, and service dependencies
- [X] CHK052 Risks section covers technical, security, and operational risks

## Readiness Assessment

**Total Items**: 52
**Completed**: 52
**Incomplete**: 0

**Status**: ✓ PASS

**Summary**: The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for the planning phase. All mandatory sections are present with comprehensive content. User stories are properly prioritized with independent test descriptions. Functional requirements are specific and testable. Success criteria are measurable. Assumptions, constraints, dependencies, and risks are thoroughly documented. No clarifications needed.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/sp.clarify` (if any questions arise) or `/sp.plan` to create the implementation plan.
